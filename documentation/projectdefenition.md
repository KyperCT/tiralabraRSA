# Project definition

The project goal is to implement RSA key generation and encrypting and decrypting files using the generated keys in Python. 
RSA is a widely used and effective method of encryption, which allows encrypted messaging such that anyone can encrypt a message (using a public key), but only one person can decrypt it
(using a private key). 

### Algorithms and data structures

For data structures, the project will use standard python implementations for all required structures (such as large integers). For algorithms, the project will use standard library 
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation etc.) for large numbers. The project will implement RSA decryption and encryption 
algorithms, as well as RSA key generation. Key generation will include the implementation of multiple other algorithms, such as searching for large primes, gcd and lcm and 
the extended Euclidian algorithm.

### Input and output

The program will have 3 commands: Key generation, encrypt and decrypt. Key generation does not take user input, and outputs a private and public key.
Encryption takes as input a message and a public key, and outputs a ciphertext. Decryption takes as input a ciphertext and a private key, and outputs the original message.
